# On-Off-Switch
An animated on-off switch.

This is HTML, CSS and JavaScript used to create an animated on-off switch consisting of two letters, "O" and "F". The switch can be toggled on and off by clicking on it.

The HTML code defines a container element with the class "switch" that contains three child elements, each with a class of "letter". The first child element is an "O" letter, and the other two child elements are "F" letters.

The CSS code sets the style for the switch and letters, including their position, size, color, and animation properties. It also defines custom CSS variables that are used to set the colors of the switch when it is on or off.

The JavaScript code adds an event listener to the switch element that toggles the "on" class when the switch is clicked. When the switch is on, the "on" class is added to the switch and each letter element, triggering their respective animations.
